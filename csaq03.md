# Azure Front Door vs Traffic Manager Comparison

| Feature | Azure Front Door | Azure Traffic Manager |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Layer** | Layer 7 (Application layer) | DNS level (outside the data path) |
| **Protocol support** | HTTP/HTTPS | Protocol-agnostic (works with any protocol) |
| **Routing methods** | Priority, Weighted, Latency | Priority, Weighted, Geographic, Subnet, MultiValue, Performance |
| **Endpoint types** | Azure & external origins | Azure, external, nested Traffic Manager profiles |
| **Health probes** | HTTP/HTTPS health probes | HTTP/HTTPS/TCP custom port health probes |
| **Traffic processing** | Processes and optimizes traffic | No traffic processing (only DNS resolution) |
| **Security features** | WAF, DDoS protection, SSL offloading | No built-in security features |
| **Caching** | Yes (integrated CDN capabilities) | No |
| **Path-based routing** | Yes | No |
| **Global availability** | Yes | Yes |
| **Failover speed** | Fast (seconds) | Slower (depends on DNS TTL) |
| **URL rewriting** | Yes | No |
| **Session affinity** | Yes | No |
| **TCP/UDP support** | No (HTTP/HTTPS only) | Yes (any protocol) |
| **Cost structure** | Based on data transfer and routing rules | Based on DNS queries and endpoints monitored |

## Use Cases

### Azure Front Door Best For:

- **Global web applications** requiring HTTP/HTTPS optimization
- **Content delivery** needing integrated CDN capabilities with load balancing
- **Modern web applications** requiring WAF protection and DDoS mitigation
- **API services** needing low-latency global distribution
- **Dynamic content acceleration** with SSL offloading and compression
- **Microservice architectures** requiring path-based routing across global deployments
- **Applications with instant failover requirements** between global regions
- **High-traffic sites** needing traffic splitting, A/B testing capabilities

### Traffic Manager Best For:

- **Non-HTTP workloads** like custom TCP/UDP applications, databases, IoT devices
- **DNS-level routing** without requiring traffic processing
- **Multi-cloud deployments** spanning Azure, other clouds, and on-premises
- **Geographic compliance scenarios** requiring precise control over user location routing
- **Blue-green deployments** using weighted traffic distribution
- **Hybrid cloud architectures** connecting Azure and non-Azure endpoints
- **Applications with custom port monitoring** requirements
- **Cost-sensitive scenarios** where DNS-level routing is sufficient

### When to Use Both Together:

- **Complex global architectures** using Traffic Manager for cross-cloud/region routing and Front Door for optimizing HTTP traffic
- **Multi-tier applications** with Traffic Manager handling coarse-grained global routing and Front Door optimizing web tier performance
- **Hybrid deployments** where Traffic Manager routes between Azure and on-premises, while Front Door optimizes the Azure portion
