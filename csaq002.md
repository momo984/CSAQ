**Question**: Describe a time you used customer feedback to improve a solution or influence a product roadmap.

**Sample Answer**:
Using customer feedback to improve solutions drives better outcomes.

- **Situation**: A telecom customer reported slow performance in their Azure-hosted billing system.
- **Task**: Use feedback to enhance the solution and share insights with Microsoft.
- **Action**:
  1. **Feedback Collection**: Conducted a workshop to gather detailed feedback, identifying latency in database queries.
  2. **Analysis**: Used Azure Application Insights to pinpoint slow queries in Azure SQL Database.
  3. **Solution**:
     - Optimized database indexes and enabled Query Store for performance tuning.
     - Scaled up the database tier to handle peak loads.
     - Configured auto-scaling to manage variable demand.
  4. **Product Feedback**: Noticed a lack of automated query optimization tools in Azure SQL. Shared this with Microsoft’s product team via internal channels, suggesting an AI-driven query optimizer.
  5. **Validation**: Tested the optimized solution, reducing query latency from 2 seconds to 200ms.
- **Result**: Improved billing system performance by 80%, increasing customer satisfaction. The product team acknowledged the feedback, incorporating similar features in a later Azure SQL update.

This approach enhanced the solution and influenced product development.
